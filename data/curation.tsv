Anna Akkara	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Heat treatment of protein extract does not prove that degradation is due to an enzyme because other cellular components also heat labile; enzyme likely but not identified
Anna Akkara	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Degradation also characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), electro spray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS); Study mentions another study (Teniola et al) that reported degradation of AFB1 by intracellular extracts so may be both intracellular/extracellular
Judi Le	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Anna Akkara	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Characterization assay was through HPLC analysis. Bacterial enzymes showed 87% ZEA degradation efficiency
Anna Akkara	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Nine enzymes were identified in the study; enzymes belong to F420H2 dependent reductase (FDR‐A and ‐B) families (enzymes that depend on F420H2 as a cofactor)
Stephanie Li	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	Saccharomyces sensu stricto are a series of different yeast strains, not just one specfic species. These different strains could have different natural environments.
Stephanie Li	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	The study was performed both in vivo and in vitro
Stephanie Li	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	Specific Aspergillus species focused on are A. clavatus, A. ochraceus, A. versicolor, and A. wentii. Found in widespread environments, not just soil.
Theresa Fallon	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Does degradation count as a form of biotransformation -- breakdown + transform target into unfunctionable state
Judi Le	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Anna Akkara	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Three experimental preparations of viable bacteria, cell free supernatant and bacterionin prep were analyzed in their ability to remove or decrease levels of mycotoxin. The strongest inhibition of growth and toxin production was observed in the presence of cultures containing viable cells and supernatants obtained from propionibacteria cultures.
Judi Le	2021-02-16T00:00:00Z	Anna Akkara	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	The enzyme responsible for the B subtilis strain UTBSP1-caused decrease in Aflotoxin mycotoxin is an extracellular constituively produced enzyme. When preparations UTBSP1 were analyzed in nutrient broth culture, in the pistachio nut and cel-free supernatant, it was found that cell-free supernatant had an efficacy rate of 78.39% decrease in AFB1 content while the other two preparations had 86% and 95% decreases.
Judi Le	2021-02-17T00:00:00Z	Anna Akkara	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	The actual pathway that the MnP enzyme took to degrade AFB1 (aflatoxin B1) was observed through 1H-NMR and HR-ESI-MS analysis. They found that AFB1 is first oxidized to AFB1-8,9-epoxide by MnP and then hydrolyzed to AFB1-8,9-dihydrodiol which is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic.
Anna Akkara	2021-02-17T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	E. coli DH5α was used as the host for constructing recombinant plasmids containing degrading gene(s); concentration of zearalenone in olutions was determined w/ HPLC

Jack Dennehy	2021-02-17T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	mechanistically this paper lookad both biotransformation and adsorption and saw results for both.
Micah Dial	2021-02-18T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-03-02T00:00:00Z	Degradation appears to be intracellular with unknown enzyme; charaacterization context is live culture
Micah Dial	2021-02-18T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-03-02T00:00:00Z	Whether the process is enzymatic is unknown at this time; CC was live culture
Micah Dial	2021-02-19T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-03-02T00:00:00Z	Removal mechanism seems to be inhibition of molds that produce B1

Theresa Fallon	2021-02-20T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Seems like in past studies it was identified that the CK1 strain had high levels of extracellular activity, although not  focused in this paper I think this can be proof of extracellular mechanism
Theresa Fallon	2021-02-20T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	This bacteria has been identified as aerobic but other studies have shown how it can survive in anaerobic environments so i think it is more accurate to say facultative anaerobe / I think they also used HPLC to look at ZEN concentration / In addition to absorption, the study also showed degradation of ZEN as a mechanism
Theresa Fallon	2021-02-20T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	should be facultative anaerobe / bacteria is often found in plants (food)
Rebecca Klausner	2021-02-21T00:00:00Z	Jack Dennehy	2021-03-02T00:00:00Z	Safety eval. confirms potential benefit of the A2 strain but mechanism of detox. is not clear
Stephanie Li	2021-02-22T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	Cytotoxicity test for AFB1 was performed using ELISA assay as well. Also some enzymes aided in degradation.

Cecilia Chase	2021-02-22T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	L.fermentum also effective in AFB removal in saline environment
Jack Dennehy	2021-02-23T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	Adsorption is taking place alongside the biodegradation. Also the enzyme is not identified but an additional note could be the previously recognized enzymes from aspergillus niger are safe for human consumption making this a viable option for toxin removal in food.
Jack Dennehy	2021-02-23T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	Could not find where the enzyme used in degradation was identified - the discussion just mentions enzyme production can vary by strain
Jack Dennehy	2021-02-23T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	This study investigates many LAB strains with varying success

Cecilia Chase	2021-02-25T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-03-09T00:00:00Z	S. cerevisiae CECT 1891 strain used.Both removal of FB1 and AFB1 analyzed. No competition for binding sites on cell walls. Presence of one toxin did not change efficiency of removal of the other.
Justin Lambright	2021-02-25T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-03-08T00:00:00Z	2 A. oryzae strains converted zearalenone into metabolites to mask the toxin, HPLC-MS/MS was used to detect metabolites, metabolism and adsoprtion of ZEN were observed
Anna Akkara	2021-03-25T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	Highest degradation activities of E. coli CG1061 appeared at pH 8.5 and 55°C; this may be useful in isolating/identifying the enzyme involved in the biotransformation or for identifying environments where the enzyme would be most effective at degrading AFB1
Anna Akkara	2021-03-25T00:00:00Z	Judi Le	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	Enzyme was identified to be extracellular

Samuel Shikora	2021-03-26T00:00:00Z	Micah Dial	2021-04-17T00:00:00Z	Check the  citation of the original article; seems to be a different article than the DOI link
Samuel Shikora	2021-03-26T00:00:00Z	Micah Dial	2021-04-17T00:00:00Z	The oxidative deamination of the hydrolysis product HFB1 by E. spinifera was investigated by TLC and mass spectrometry. The paper mentions the use of PCR, Inverse PCR, FB1 degradation assay, HFB1 deamination assay.
Samuel Shikora	2021-03-26T00:00:00Z	Micah Dial	2021-04-17T00:00:00Z	T2 and HT2 absorbed via symplast may encounter enzymes that prevent the toxins from getting into the xylem, by turning them in substances easily segregated in vacuoles or in the apoplast of parenchimatous root cells
Samuel Shikora	2021-03-26T00:00:00Z	Micah Dial	2021-04-17T00:00:00Z	The epimerization of DON to 3-epi-DON requires NADP(H), indicating the involvement of dehydrogenases/oxidoreductases in the process.

Jack Dennehy	2021-04-03T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	I did not see where it said the experiment was conducted under aerobic/anaerobic conditions. Also shares data for fumonisin removal.
Jack Dennehy	2021-04-03T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	This paper investigates 3 strains with some ability to remove the toxin
Jack Dennehy	2021-04-03T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	S. bayanus was another strain also able to remove Ochratoxin A
Jack Dennehy	2021-04-03T00:00:00Z	Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	Can also add that this provides a safe removal with corn oil (not toxic)
Stephanie Li	2021-04-05T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-04-20T00:00:00Z	Typically found in soil from rice or rice plant specifically, paper also dicusses Rhizopus oryzae
Stephanie Li	2021-04-05T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-04-20T00:00:00Z	water environments are typically freshwater, also sulfhydryl enzymes (for reducing toxicity of cadmium)
Stephanie Li	2021-04-05T00:00:00Z	Theresa Fallon	2021-04-20T00:00:00Z	Also found on surface of human skin, hospital environments, and respiratory and GI tracts. Fluorescence detector used in addition to HPLC.

Micah Dial	2021-04-06T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	Check on the removal mechanism - the article doesn't mention yeast. Also - Article states that alkaline phosphatase is a measure of FB1 levels, not a biotransformative enzyme
Cecilia Chase	2021-04-07T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	Important to note that the ZEN toxin was removed in wort between 31 and 72%, and the toxin adsorbed to S.cervisiae  ranged between 4.5 and 31.3%. Shows not all toxin was adsorbed by yeast. Likely extracellular mechanism, but unknown.
Cecilia Chase	2021-04-07T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	S. pastorianus is likely an opportunistic pathogen, as it is part of the Saccharomyces genus. Main removal mechanism discussed is adsorbtion. LC–QTOF–MS(/MS) analysis used along with LC–TQ–MS/MS.
Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-07T00:00:00Z	Jack Dennehy	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	strains mediate OTA biodegradation under anaerobic conditions, may be suitable as silage inoculants or as feed additives
Cecilia Chase	2021-04-07T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	Lactobacillius plantarum is also found in saliva and food products. B2 strain had highest degredation ability while D10 strain showed fast binding, but was released in stationary phase.
Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-07T00:00:00Z	Jack Dennehy	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	Due to antibiotics production, Streptomyces strains cannot be used in biodegradation methods as a member of inocula
Cecilia Chase	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Justin Lambright	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	First study to show that Paradevosia has biotransformation ability. Has no mention if enzymatic/intra/extracellular, future studies still need to be completed.
Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Jack Dennehy	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	Major mechanism of microbial detoxification is attributed to either the adsorption or enzyme action
Rebecca Klausner	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Jack Dennehy	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	the increase of amino acid concentration may owe to the degradation of Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase
Theresa Fallon	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	It seems like the study didn't identify whether the mechanism of degradation was biotransformation or absorption. It only really looked at the binding aspect.
Micah Dial	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	The article suggests that the mechanism is enzymatic as it involves the biotransformation of zearalenone into a less harmful metabolite - enzyme remains unidentified, however
Justin Lambright	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	There needs to be further research to confirm the removal was by biodegredation but the authors assume it was. No enzyme was identified but likely one involved for degredation.
Justin Lambright	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	I. lacteus usually found on rotting wood/logs. Recombinant DNA technology used to transform E. coli to clone and isolate the MnPs. LC-MS/MS used to analyze AFB1 transformation products.
Justin Lambright	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	used intracellular extracts which showed ability of induced and constitutive enzymes to completely stop genotoxicity of AFB1 within minutes while constitituve enzymes alone took 6 hours, has been a case of bloodstream infection caused by R. erythropolis in immunocompromised male
Justin Lambright	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	B. licheniforms mainly causes infection in immunocompromised but is recognized as a human pathogen. The genes of 2 enzymes, Chia010 and Lac010, likely involved in the biodegredation of AFB1 were found through bioinformatics and the secondary structures were determined through sequence analysis. Futher research of these enzymes is necessary to confirm their role in biodegredation.
Micah Dial	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	The article seems to indicate that a sulfatase enzyme was used to hydrolyze a ZEL-sulfate metabolite, rather than the zearalenone itself
Theresa Fallon	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	This bacteria can also be found in meat, mouth and intestines of humans and rats.
Theresa Fallon	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	S. cerevisiae is an eukarya and it can also be found in many environents including soil, plants, trees, insects, and humans. Seems like the study doesn't explain a direct mechanism of absorption, but they also mention the binding of yeast-OTA is on the cell surface or hypothesize that it is something on the surface of yeasts.
Theresa Fallon	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Stephanie Li	2021-04-21T00:00:00Z	Lactobacillus pentosus fall under the L. plantarum group and they can be found in many places like vegetables, meat, dairy as well as GI tract. Experiment conducted in liquid culture.
Micah Dial	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Samuel Shikora	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	C. roeseum is non-pathogenic to humans, but is a parasite of other fungi and some nematodes
