Non induced BL010 did not have degredation capability	Justin Lambright	2021-04-08T00:00:00Z	Cecilia Chase	2021-04-22T00:00:00Z	B. licheniforms mainly causes infection in immunocompromised but is recognized as a human pathogen. The genes of 2 enzymes, Chia010 and Lac010, likely involved in the biodegredation of AFB1 were found through bioinformatics and the secondary structures were determined through sequence analysis. Futher research of these enzymes is necessary to confirm their role in biodegredation.	Opportunistic	Facultative	Aflatoxin B1	Intracellular

Seems like the study doesn't explain a direct mechanism of absorption, but they also mention the binding of yeast-OTA is on the cell surface or hypothesize that it is something on the surface of yeasts.
